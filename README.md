# AI-Powered Credit Fraud Detection and Prevention System

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered credit fraud detection and prevention system. The goal is to identify suspicious transactions in real-time, prevent fraudulent activities, and minimize false positives while adapting to evolving fraud trends. This system aims to reduce credit fraud losses, improve detection accuracy, and enhance customer experience through the application of machine learning algorithms, anomaly detection techniques, and real-time data analysis.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

* Design and develop an AI-powered credit fraud detection and prevention system.
* Detect and prevent credit fraud in real-time.
* Improve the accuracy of fraud detection.
* Enhance the security of credit transactions.
* Adapt to emerging fraud threats.
* Ultimately provide a secure and reliable transaction experience for customers.

## Scope

The scope of this project includes:

* Analyzing credit transaction data to identify patterns and anomalies.
* Developing and training machine learning models for credit fraud detection.
* Implementing real-time fraud detection capabilities.
* Visualizing AI-powered credit fraud detection results using:
    1.  Confusion Matrix
    2.  ROC Curve
    3.  Precision-Recall Curve
    4.  Heatmaps
* Interpreting the results to:
    1.  Identify high-risk transactions
    2.  Analyze errors in detection
    3.  Monitor the performance of the fraud detection system
    4.  Understand the importance of different features in the model
* Refining the model based on the interpreted results to improve accuracy.
