# AI-Powered Credit Fraud Detection and Prevention System

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered credit fraud detection and prevention system. The primary goal is to identify suspicious transactions in real-time, prevent fraudulent activities, and minimize false positives while adapting to evolving threats. The system aims to reduce credit fraud losses, improve detection accuracy, and enhance customer experience through the application of machine learning algorithms, anomaly detection techniques, and real-time data analysis.

## Project Objectives

The main objective of this model building project is to develop an accurate machine learning model that can detect and prevent credit fraud transactions in real-time. Key considerations include minimizing false positives, ensuring model interpretability, and optimizing performance for large transaction volumes.

Specifically, the AI-powered credit fraud detection system aims to:

* Monitor transactions in real-time.
* Identify suspicious patterns with high accuracy.
* Achieve minimal false positives.
* Leverage machine learning models and behavioral analytics to detect anomalies.
* Adapt to evolving fraud tactics.
* Ensure the system is scalable and secure.

## Problem Statement

The increasing sophistication of fraudulent activities in credit card transactions necessitates the development of advanced detection and prevention systems. Traditional rule-based systems often struggle to keep pace with evolving fraud techniques and may result in a high number of false positives, impacting customer experience. This project addresses this challenge by developing an AI-powered system capable of real-time analysis and adaptation.
